                    <h2>About This Group</h2>
                    <p>Welcome to the Business Group — a community for students who want to explore business, startups, and entrepreneurship beyond the classroom. Since IB doesn't directly teach business, this is our chance to learn hands-on — whether it's launching an online shop, planning a micro-bakery through Bolt, or exploring marketing and management tools.</p>
                    <p>We'll work together, delegate roles, learn new skills, and support each other's personal projects or team initiatives. The aim is to gain real-world experience while having fun building something meaningful as a group.</p>
                    <p>If we get more than 4 people, we'll host an introductory meeting where members can vote to revise or stick with the current goals and ideas.</p>

                    <h2>Meeting Structure & Schedule</h2>
                    <p>We plan to meet once per week, or more if needed, to brainstorm, organize, delegate tasks, and track progress on group or individual business projects.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Additional Details</h3>
                    <p><strong>Contact:</strong> WhatsApp group link will be sent via email</p>
                    <p><strong>Organization:</strong> A shared workspace with planning resources and task delegation will be introduced in the first meeting</p>
                    <p><strong>Meeting Times:</strong> Will be decided collectively after reviewing everyone's availability; most likely weekly</p>
                    <p><strong>Location:</strong> Will be set based on convenience — potentially in the library or any quiet planning space</p>

                    <h2>CAS Relevance</h2>
                    <p>This group has strong potential to count as Creativity, Service, or even Activity for CAS — especially with documented contributions, teamwork, and leadership. We'll check the specific CAS rules to confirm anything unclear.</p>
