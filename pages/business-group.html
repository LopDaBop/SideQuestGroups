                    <h2>Welcome to the Business Group!</h2>
                    <p>This is a community for students who want to explore business, startups, and entrepreneurship beyond the classroom. Since IB doesn’t directly teach business in Tartu, this is our chance to learn TOGETHER. Whether it’s launching an online shop, planning a small bakery through Bolt, or exploring marketing and management tools, we will try to start something cost-free, and profit off of it!</p>
                    <p>It is not yet decided which projects to commence, but either way we can split into small teams to work on individual projects or work together to build something requiring many hands. The plan is to divide responsibilities so that each person can focus on a specific area of the business, based on their interests and strengths. For example:</p>
                    <p>
                    <strong>Product Development –</strong> the team responsible for creating, improving, or maintaining the product or service.<br>
                    <strong>Marketing and Outreach –</strong> the people who promote the product, build the brand, and connect with potential customers.<br>
                    <strong>Finance and Budgeting –</strong> those who track expenses, calculate profit, and ensure the business remains financially sustainable.
                    </p>
                    <p>We’ll learn as we go, picking up new skills through trial and error. The main goal is to get an experience not just in business, but in teamwork, problem-solving, and creating something meaningful together.</p>
                    <p>If we get more than 3 people, we’ll host an introductory meeting where members can vote to revise or stick with the current goals and ideas.</p>

                <div class="info-section">
                    <h2>Meeting Structure & Schedule</h2>
                    <p>We plan to meet once per week [or more if needed] to brainstorm, organize, work on efficiency, and overall to discuss how everything is progressing.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Additional Details</h3>
                    <p><strong>Contact:</strong> WhatsApp group link will be sent via email</p>
                    <p><strong>Organization:</strong> A shared workspace with planning resources and task delegation will be introduced in the first meeting</p>
                    <p><strong>Meeting Times:</strong> Will be decided collectively after reviewing everyone’s availability; most likely weekly</p>
                    <p><strong>Location:</strong> Will be set based on convenience, [potentially in the library or any quiet planning space]</p>

                    <h2>CAS Relevance</h2>
                    <p>This group has strong potential to count as [Creativity], [Service], or even [Activity] for CAS — especially with documented contributions, teamwork, and leadership. We’ll check the specific CAS rules to confirm anything unclear.</p>
