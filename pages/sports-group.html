                    <h2>Welcome to the Sports Group!</h2>
                    <p>A mutual group for anyone who wants to stay active, motivated, and exercised. Whether it’s volleyball, running, climbing, or other potential group activities, the main goal of this group is about having fun, staying healthy, and building discipline together.</p>
                    <p>You <strong>DON’T</strong> need to be good at sports to join this group, just show up with the will to participate and try to stay determined! Sessions will be casual but consistent, and we’ll focus on sports that the majority can enjoy. Keep in mind that it’s not entirely about competition, so try to enjoy the activity, and bonding as a team.</p>
                    <p>If we gather more than 4 interested people, we’ll hold a kick-off meeting to collectively discuss the group goals based on everyone’s expectations, and we will decide on a number of potential sports.</p>

                    <h2>Meeting Structure & Schedule</h2>
                    <p>We aim for weekly or biweekly sessions, depending on activity type and participant availability. Sessions will most probably rotate based on interest [one week could be volleyball, another week a park run, etc.]</p>
                    
                    <h3>Additional Details</h3>

                    <p><strong>Meeting Times:</strong> Will be selected based on applications; typically once a week or every two weeks</p>
                    <p><strong>Location:</strong> Will change depending on the activity [e.g., park, sports field, indoor gym]</p>

                    <h2>CAS Relevance</h2>
                    <p>This group is a great candidate for the Activity strand in CAS. Regular attendance and participation can count. As for creativity and service, depending on the sport we could get those two down as well!</p>
