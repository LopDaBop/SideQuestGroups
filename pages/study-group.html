                    <h2>About This Group</h2>
                    <p>Welcome to the Study Group — a space built for students who want to stay consistent, support each other, and enjoy the studying process. Whether you're preparing for exams, tackling assignments, or just need motivation to focus, this group is designed to help you succeed through collaboration.</p>
                    <p>We'll work together to review material, solve problems, share resources, and push each other to keep going. The goal is consistent academic growth in a relaxed but driven environment, where everyone benefits from mutual support.</p>
                    <p>If we gather more than 4 members, we'll hold a first meeting to decide, as a group, whether to keep the goals as they are or to reshape them based on everyone's input.</p>

                    <h2>Meeting Structure & Schedule</h2>
                    <p>We plan to meet frequently — possibly daily or several times a week, depending on everyone's schedule and preferences. The group can use Pomodoro-style focused sessions, shared explanations, or just quiet study time together.</p>
